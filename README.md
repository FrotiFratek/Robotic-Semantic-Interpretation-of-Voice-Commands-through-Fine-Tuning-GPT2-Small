# Robotic-Semantic-Interpretation-of-Voice-Commands-through-Fine-Tuning-GPT2-Small

This project fine-tunes the gpt2-small model to generate semantic Graphviz (DOT) code based on pick-and-place commands for robots. The goal is to translate natural language instructions into structured graph representations.

The training dataset, graphviz_dataset.csv, contains 10,000 commandâ€“graph pairs generated using GPT-4o. A supporting file, Reduced_Word_Sets.csv, lists the vocabulary used by GPT-4o to construct the dataset.

Two versions of the test set are included (test_set_v2.csv and test_set_fixed.csv), representing the same examples in slightly different formats.

Model predictions are saved in predictions_cleaned.csv and predictions_fine_tuned_gpt2.csv, which contain both expected and generated Graphviz outputs. These were used to assess the fine-tuned model across multiple evaluation metrics, including BLEU, ROUGE, Exact Match, structural similarity, and syntactic validity.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo
2. Install requirements from `requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code

## Requirements
Python version: 3.12.7
transformers: 4.49.0
torch: 2.6.0+cpu
pandas: 2.2.2
evaluate: 0.4.3
tqdm: 4.66.5
pydot: 3.0.4
graphviz: 0.20.3

## Example

**Prompt:**
 Command: Take the pink shirt from the round table and hook it on the hanger. 

**Non-Fine-Tuned Output:**
 Command: Take the pink shirt from the round table and hook it on the hanger.

[00:00:00]EMOTE: *no key*/(monkey (912)) : <b>The monkey (912)</b>

**Fine-Tuned Output (Generated Graph):**
```dot
digraph SemanticGraph {
    node [shape=ellipse, style=filled, fillcolor=white];
    table [label="table"];
    round [label="round"];
    hook [label="hook", shape=box, fillcolor=lightblue];
    shirt [label="shirt"];
    hanger [label="hanger"];
    take [label="Take", shape=box, fillcolor=lightblue];
    pink [label="Pink"];

    round -> table [label="attribute"];
    take -> shirt [label="object"];
    take -> table [label="from"];
    hook -> shirt [label="object"];
    hook -> hanger [label="on"];
}
